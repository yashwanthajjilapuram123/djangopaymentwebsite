This function is responsible for handling the logic related to amounttransfer endpoint.
It is protected from csrf attacks and transaction happens only if it is atomic.
if request is POST, data is extracted from request and cleaned.
Unique request id is created when amount is transferred to other user.
Once this is done, user currency and payee currency is checked it is same then 
conversion get api is not called, if it not same api is called which converts the amount.
Transfer happens only if user is having account balance greater than the amount he needs to transfer
and data is saved on MoneyTransfer model where status is updated as send for payer
and received for payee, it will be an atomic transaction and messages are displayed if user have insufficient balance
transfer does not take place in that case.

If it is a accept button , it goes inside accept block and then if user amount is greater than his balance then 
money transfer happens and amount is deducted from payer account and record is created in MoneyTransfer model,

If it is a reject button, simply status is updated as declined for payer and rejected for one who requested payment.
